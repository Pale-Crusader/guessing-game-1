        <h1>Bio</h1>
        <p>My name is Peyton Cysewski. I currently live in Kirkland and have actually live there my entire life. I attended 
            The Bear Creek School, a private school, all the way from K-12 before going to Washington State University for three 
            and a half years. I tried a lot of different things from ROTC to choir to being a part of my local church. Nothing 
            really stuck and it became clear colllege wasn't my cup of tea so that is why I am here at CodeFellows. The only jobs 
            I have had have been menial, summer, college jobs such as working at Costco for a few months and at a golf course. 
            My goal is to ultimately start my career!
